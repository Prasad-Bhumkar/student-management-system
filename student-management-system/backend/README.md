### SQL Example for Creating a Credentials Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE credentials (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- Auto-incrementing ID for each record
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- User's email, must be unique
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- User's password (hashed)
    remember_me BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- Whether the user chose to be remembered
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- Timestamp for when the record was created
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- Timestamp for when the record was last updated
);
```

### Explanation of the Fields

- **id**: A unique identifier for each credential record.
- **email**: The user's email address, which must be unique to prevent duplicate accounts.
- **password**: The user's password. It is highly recommended to store hashed passwords instead of plain text for security reasons.
- **remember_me**: A boolean field indicating whether the user opted to be remembered (e.g., for persistent login).
- **created_at**: A timestamp indicating when the record was created.
- **updated_at**: A timestamp that updates automatically whenever the record is modified.

### Important Considerations

1. **Password Security**: Always hash passwords before storing them in the database. Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2.
2. **Email Verification**: Consider implementing email verification to ensure that users own the email addresses they provide.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that you comply with data protection regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) when handling user credentials.
4. **Indexing**: You may want to add indexes on fields that are frequently queried, such as the email field.

### Example of Hashing a Password in Node.js

If you're using Node.js, you can hash passwords using the `bcrypt` library:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const saltRounds = 10;
const plainPassword = 'userPassword123';

bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
    // Store hash in your password database.
});
```

### Conclusion

Creating a credentials table is a fundamental step in building a user authentication system. Ensure that you follow best practices for security and data management when implementing this feature.
